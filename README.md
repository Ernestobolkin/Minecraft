# Minecraft 2d Game


## About the game:

The minecraft that you can see here is based on the original game, but in 2d.
In the actual game the user has more options, so I decided to take the basic things:

**1.Mining trees**
**2.Mining dirt**
**3.Mining stone**
**4.building**

The mining functions come with the specific tools.
The user can mine trees with the axe, the dirt you need a shovel and stone is picaxe. if the user treis to brake a block with the wrong tool it will warn him.
By the right side, where the nave bar is and all the tools, there is a little block that contains the last block that was mined. when you click on it, it gives the user the option to place the block on the map.


## Building the world:

Behind the scenes I have a function that gives a random options to the clouds, trees and the houses. so the user can generate a random world.
The game is build with 20 rows by 25 columns, 1 row of grass and 2 rows of dirt.
Furthermore I added sun and the moon to my game, so the user can "feel" the time changes, so as time passes by, the night comes.

Unfortunately the game has not done yet, it is not responsive and the chest part doens't work. I believe that Ill finish the game soon and add more features.
